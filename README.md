# SC1015-Mini-Project

## About
This mini Project for SC1015 (Introduction To Data Science And Artificial Intelligence) looks at game information from Steam.We used the [Steam Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fronkongames/steam-games-dataset) from kaggle.

## Problem Definition
Can we predict the price of a game using its features?

## Models Used
- Random Forest: Random Forest Regressor from Sci-Kit Learn
- Decision Tree: Decision Tree Regressor from Sci-Kit Learn
- Neural Network: MLPRegressor from Sci-Kit Learn

## Conclusion
- The features of game (categories, tags, genres etc.) can influence price to a degree, but is not a strong predictor.
- There may be other complex factors that influence pricing in the game market.

## What we learnt
- New regression models: Random Forest, Neural Network
- Hyperparameter tuning
